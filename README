Small Windows Utility Repository
================================

This repository contains some small single-source-file utilities written by me
over time, specifically on Windows. These utilities were made when they were
needed, and were subject to neither quality assurance nor quality control.

Each file in the 'src' directory is the source code of a single utility. Some
functions are present in multiple files, since every tool was designed to be
a stand-alone executable with a single file of source code (except the resources
needed to enable visual styles on GUI software). The style of the source code
is similar to the Windows API's style, using hungarian notation and types
defined by the Windows API. These tools do not use the C standard library, only
function provided by Windows facilities, making the operating system itself
their only dependency. Every tool was planned to be compatible with every
Windows version, starting with Windows NT 4.0 (with visual styles disabled for
versions before Windows XP).

Since Cygwin was used for building on Windows, the tools one need to build them
are the cross-compiler variants of 'gcc', 'windres', and 'make', as these tools
are available for both Windows and Linux systems. This requires some tools to
be installed on the build system.

- Cygwin: mingw64-x86_64-gcc, mingw64-x86_64-binutils
- ArchLinux: mingw-w64-gcc, mingw-w64-binutils
- Ubuntu: gcc-mingw-w64, binutils-mingw-w64-x86-64
- Fedora: mingw64-gcc, mingw64-binutils

Resulting files will be put to the 'bin' directory, ready to use.

The following tools are maintained in the repository.
- killall.exe: Name-based process killing utility.
- forceshow.exe: Forces the visibility of a window based on its title.
- adminrun.exe: Runs the specified command as administrator.
- mdicapture.exe: Provides an MDI frame, to which external windows can be added.
- modules.exe: Lists the loaded modules (the EXE and DLLs) of a running process.
- dbglist.exe: Listens to and displays OutputDebugString() messages system-wide.
- errcode.exe: Takes error codes as arguments, and prints their description.
- topology.exe: Toggles between cloned and extending display topology.
- wndpids.exe: Lists the PID of each top-level window's process.
