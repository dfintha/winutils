Small Windows Utility Repository
================================

This repository contains some small single-source-file utilities I've written
over time, specifically on Windows. These utilities were made when they were
needed, and were subject to neither quality assurance nor quality control.

Each file in the 'src' directory is the source code of a single utility. Since
I've used Cygwin when I worked on Windows, the tools one need to build them are
the Cygwin variants of 'gcc', 'g++', and 'make'.

Resulting files will be put to the 'bin' directory, ready to use.

The following tools are maintained in the repository.
- killall.exe: Name-based process killing utility.
- forceshow.exe: Forces the visibility of a window based on its title.
